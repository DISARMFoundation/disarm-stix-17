The most simple set of narrative techniques in response would be the construction and promotion of contradictory alternatives centred on denial, deflection, dismissal, counter-charges, excessive standards of proof, bias in prohibition or enforcement, and so on. These competing narratives allow loyalists cover, but are less compelling to opponents and fence-sitters than campaigns built around existing narratives or highly explanatory master narratives. Competing narratives, as such, are especially useful in the \"firehose of misinformation\" approach.",

An influence operation may use automated activity to increase content exposure without dedicating the resources, including personnel and time, traditionally required to forward and repost content. Use bots to amplify narratives above algorithm thresholds. Bots are automated/programmed profiles designed to amplify content (ie: automatically retweet or like) and give appearance it's more \"popular\" than it is. They can operate as a network, to function in a coordinated/orchestrated manner. In some cases (more so now) they are an inexpensive/disposable assets used for minimal deployment as bot detection tools improve and platforms are more responsive.",

Data voids are hard to detect and relatively harmless until exploited by an entity aiming to quickly proliferate false or misleading information during a phenomenon that causes a high number of individuals to query the term or phrase. In the Plan phase, an influence operation may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation. A 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) \u201cBreaking news\u201d data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a \u201cstrategic new terms\u201d data void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on \u201coutdated terms\u201d that have decreased in popularity, capitalising on most search engines\u2019 preferences for recency. (4) \u201cFragmented concepts\u201d data voids separate connections between similar ideas, isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results. (5) An influence operation may use \u201cproblematic queries\u201d that previously resulted in disturbing or inappropriate content to promote messaging until mainstream media recontextualizes the term.",

            "description": "A data void refers to a word or phrase that results in little, manipulative, or low-quality search engine data. Data voids are hard to detect and relatively harmless until exploited by an entity aiming to quickly proliferate false or misleading information during a phenomenon that causes a high number of individuals to query the term or phrase. In the Plan phase, an influence operation may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation. A 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) \u201cBreaking news\u201d data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a \u201cstrategic new terms\u201d data void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on \u201coutdated terms\u201d that have decreased in popularity, capitalising on most search engines\u2019 preferences for recency. (4) \u201cFragmented concepts\u201d data voids separate connections between similar ideas, isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results. (5) An influence operation may use \u201cproblematic queries\u201d that previously resulted in disturbing or inappropriate content to promote messaging until mainstream media recontextualizes the term.",

            "description": "Concealing sponsorship aims to mislead or obscure the identity of the hidden sponsor behind an operation rather than entity publicly running the operation. Operations that conceal sponsorship may maintain visible falsified groups, news outlets, non-profits, or other organisations, but seek to mislead or obscure the identity sponsoring, funding, or otherwise supporting these entities. Influence operations may use a variety of techniques to mask the location of their social media accounts to complicate attribution and conceal evidence of foreign interference. Operation accounts may set their location to a false place, often the location of the operation\u2019s target audience, and post in the region\u2019s language",

For example, @wosuhitsu1972 was involved in at least five Matryoshka operations from 14 to 28 March 2024, in turn as a quoter, a seeder, a seeder, a quoter then a seeder.\u201d</i><br><br>Quoting another account\u2019s post and tagging another individual is not by itself indicative of the Seed and Ping strategy; many people will legitimately encounter content which they would like to draw to the attention of influencers, or to ask for material to be verified by journalists.<br><br>To make the assessment that assets are collaborating to use a Seed and Ping strategy, analysts need to confirm that assets do not disclose an association with each other, and yet have repeatedly interacted by quoting each others\u2019 posts and tagging another unrelated asset asking them to review the posted content. <br><br>Since assets switch role of Seeder and Pinger, analysts may observe this switch as an indicator of collaboration. They may also look for assets collaborating outside of a pair - it could be many assets collaborating to Seed and Ping each other (i.e. it\u2019s not the case that two assets always switch between Seeding and Pinging for each other).",
