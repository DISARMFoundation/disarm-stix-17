Anecdotal evidence is not credible because it is based on a small sample size (often one person), there is a lack of control (unlike in a controlled experiment), we don\u2019t have causation so we don\u2019t know if the variable in question is the cause of the effect we\u2019re looking at.<br><br>To make the assertion that a narrative is using an anecdote they must have a very small sample size (typically one person), it is not from a controlled setting, and we must not have direct proven causation.",
