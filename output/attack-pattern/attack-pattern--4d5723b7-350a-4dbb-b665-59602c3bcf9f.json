            "description": "This sub-technique can be used to document an analyst\u2019s assessment that AI was employed to generate AI-nudified imagery. AI-nudified imagery refers to the use of artificial intelligence to modify an existing image or video by digitally altering the subject to appear unclothed, typically through the application of machine learning algorithms that remove or replace clothing with simulated content.<br><br>Platforms designed to nudify imagery require users to upload an image of a person fully clothed as the source content. The AI then applies algorithms to remove the clothing, effectively generating a synthetic image or video of the subject in a nude state.",
