However, people have been observed using data selectively with the intent of producing evidence to support their claim, rather than building a claim based on unbiased evidence.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts will need to confirm that data has been selectively chosen to support a given claim, and that it has not been discounted for legitimate reasons.",
