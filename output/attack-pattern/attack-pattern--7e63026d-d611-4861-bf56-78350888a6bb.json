            "description": "This sub-technique can be used to assert that a piece of content is a sexual AI-Generated deepfake impersonation (sometimes referred to as \u201cAI Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery\u201d / \u201cAI NCII\u201d); a deepfake which has placed a target into a sexual scene, or depicts them sexually.<br><br>A deepfake refers to AI-generated content that artificially inserts the likeness of a real person into a new or altered media scene. These synthetic images, videos, or audio clips use machine learning models to manipulate or replace the original content, making it appear as though the target is participating in actions or situations they never actually did.<br><br>To identify sexual deepfake impersonations, analysts will need to confirm that the imagery has been generated using AI, and to assert that the imagery is sexual in nature. The nature of what is considered sexual can differ based on cultural context. Analysts will need to consider the societal norms of the targeted individual, or the audience of the deepfake when asserting whether it is sexual in nature.<br><br>As AI continues to develop capability to produce more realistic media, it is difficult to provide a list of methods to spot materials that have been created using AI which will not rapidly become outdated; platforms providing AI media generation are attempting to make the materials they produce indistinguishable from media made by humans. <br><br>At the same time, organisations create tools designed to help identify AI-generated content, and publish resources listing the latest tells and identifiers for AI-generated content. Analysts may look for such tools or resources to help identify the use of AI.",
