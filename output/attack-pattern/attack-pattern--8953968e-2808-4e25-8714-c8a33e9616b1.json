It masks IP Addresses, enhancing privacy and security by preventing unauthorised access and tracking. VPNs are commonly used for protecting sensitive information, bypassing geographic restrictions, and maintaining online anonymity.<br><br>VPNs can also allow a threat actor to pose as if they are located in one country while in reality being based in another. By doing so, they can try to either mis-attribute their activities to another actor or better hide their own identity.",
