Actors also secretively photograph women from afar for sexual gratification (\u201cCreepshots\u201d).<br><br>Analysts will need to make an assessment about whether content was produced for sexual gratification, and whether the depicted individual was aware they were being filmed. Analysts may use context of the platform or community the content was posted to, or how it was described by the actor, to make such an assessment.",
