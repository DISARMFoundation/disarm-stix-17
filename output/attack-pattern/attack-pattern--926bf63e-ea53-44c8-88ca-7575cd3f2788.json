This feature is not exclusive to Social Media Platforms; the Microblogging Platform X (prev. Twitter) allows users to create \u201cX Communities\u201d, groups based on particular topics which users can join and post to; the Software Delivery Platform Steam allows users to create Steam Community Groups.<br><br>Online Community Groups can be open or gated (for example, groups can require admin approval before users can join).",
