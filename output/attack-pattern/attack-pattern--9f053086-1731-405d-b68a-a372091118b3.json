            "description": "Threat actors have been observed editing media depicting locations in targeted countries to impose materials that imply locals are protesting against a cause ((e.g. falsified graffiti protesting continued support for Ukraine resisting Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion)[https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20240611_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_Matriochka_EN_VF.pdf]) or that authorities are taking a stance ((e.g. falsified government billboard ads rallying locals against Ukraine)[https://www.stopfake.org/en/strong-photofake-anti-ukrainian-billboards-appear-in-poland-strong/]) which are beneficial to the threat actor\u2019s narrative.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts may review images or video for digital artifacts indicative of edited media. They may look for source media which directly match the edited content without the presence of the purported graffiti or signage. They may check for the existence of footage depicting the purported graffiti or signage from other angles.",
