AI Media Platforms such as Descript, Fliki, Murf AI, PlayHT, and Resemble AI can be used to generate synthetic voice. <br><br>Some platforms implement protections against misuse of AI by their users. Threat Actors have been observed bypassing these protections using prompt injections, poisoning, jailbreaking, or integrity attacks.",
