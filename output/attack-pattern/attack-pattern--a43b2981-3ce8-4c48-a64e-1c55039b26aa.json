            "description": "Academic research can be retracted in cases where issues with the report are uncovered, including errors with how the research was conducted, corruption on behalf of the researchers, fake peer reviews, or publishing multiple papers based on the same data. Research such as this which has been retracted is sometimes still used to support claims, without acknowledging the results are not valid.<br><br>To count as a citation, the content must explicitly point to a specific piece of academic research to support a claim. This could be via an embedded link, footnotes, or providing the name of a paper, the journal it appears in, and the researchers who produced it.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to identify the cited article, and confirm that it has been discredited. They may do this by searching for retracted academic research on publicly available databases such as (Retraction Watch,)[https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/] or by contacting the publishing journal.",
