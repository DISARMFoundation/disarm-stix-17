By editing out the context that they were quoting an opponent, the speaker can be made to look like they were making the statement themselves. <br><br>To make this assertion, analysts need to identify the original source of a statement (e.g. written argument, video interview, podcast, etc), and confirm that in its original context it has a different meaning, or interpretation.",
