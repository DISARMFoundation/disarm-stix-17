            "description": "A narrative makes a claim, and points to academic research to back up the legitimacy of the claim - however, the research does not actually exist.<br><br>Citation of nonexistent academic research can occur when using AI-LLMs to write reports. [AI models are trained to mimic language that humans use by predicting one word after another in a sequence. Although AI chatbots like ChatGPT often succeed in producing text that reads like it was written by a human, they often fail to ensure that what they\u2019re saying is factual.](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/rfk-jr-fake-citations-medical-journals/) Because of this, they may produce citations which look correct, but don\u2019t point to research that really exists.<br><br>To count as a citation, the content must explicitly point to a specific piece of academic research to support a claim. This could be via an embedded link, footnotes, or providing the name of a paper, the journal it appears in, and the researchers who produced it.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts must confirm that the cited research does not exist (while being lenient against honest mistakes such as slight errors in how the research is named), by investigating each citation made and confirming it exists as described.<br><br>For example, [this Fact Check](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/rfk-jr-fake-citations-medical-journals/) looked into citations made in a report which was purportedly produced using AI:<br><br><i>\u201dOne of the fake articles flagged by NOTUS was titled, \u201cChanges in mental health and substance use among US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d [...]<br><br>\u201cA closer examination of the citation shows why it\u2019s not authentic: Searching the title does not yield a real article, clicking the DOI link in the citation leads to an error page saying \u201cDOI not found,\u201d and looking at the JAMA Pediatrics volume and issue number referenced leads to an article with a different title and different authors.\u201d</i>",
