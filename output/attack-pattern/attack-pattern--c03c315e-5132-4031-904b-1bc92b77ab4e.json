This is sometimes referred to as \u201c(deceptive clickbait)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216623002643#bib4:~:text=%E2%80%9Cdeceptive%E2%80%9D%20clickbait.]\u201d, It differs from clickbait in that instead of creating a knowledge gap to induce clicking, they create a headline which tells a \u2018full story\u2019 but leads to an interpretation which misrepresents the material\u2019s contents in such a way that makes the reader believe its material is highly relevant or interesting to them.<br><br>Users of social media platforms often do not click in to view online content, and as such commonly only see its\u2019 title, where effectively experience the headline of a piece of content as the whole content. In cases where a screenshot of a title is posted, users are unable to view the rest of the content for context. Titles which misrepresent content can then mislead people into believing false information. <br><br>Fact Checkers have observed cases where viral information could be debunked simply by checking the article (common for headlines produced by satirical media outlets).<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts will need to review the article or video and make the assessment as to whether its title accurately reflects its content.
