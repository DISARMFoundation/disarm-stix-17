Instead of neutrally seeking information, the questioner embeds assumptions, implications, or emotional cues that make certain answers seem more acceptable or obvious.<br><br>To make the assertion that a narrative is using leading questions can be based on several rhetorical methods: bias present in the words (eg. saying \u201csmashed\u201d instead of \u201chit\u201d), use of assumptions that are inbuilt (eg. when did you stop stealing roadsigns) or the use of a tag at the end to solicit agreement (eg. you did eat all of my pancakes, didn\u2019t you?). Many leading questions can be answered through a yes or a no answer (eg. my pancakes were delicious, weren\u2019t they?).",
