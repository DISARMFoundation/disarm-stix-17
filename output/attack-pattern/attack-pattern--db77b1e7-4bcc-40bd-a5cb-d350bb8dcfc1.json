Rhetorical devices are used to make an argument more persuasive or appealing to an audience. <br><br>Rhetorical devices are not inherently malicious; people naturally use many in their day-to-day lives, talking to friends, family, and colleagues. However, they can be used with intent to manipulate, to push a particular point, to persuade targets to believe a certain way, and analysts have noted that some actors regularly deploy the same rhetorical devices (e.g. Russian actors have been observed using Whataboutism). <br><br>It can be useful to document the different rhetorical devices used in operations to influence targets.",
