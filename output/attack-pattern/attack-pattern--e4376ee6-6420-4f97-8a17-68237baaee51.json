For example, a wide angle shot showing a person holding a sign at a counter-protest could be cropped to remove the sign, allowing for a new narrative that they were part of the original protest.<br><br>To make this assessment, analysts will need to find the original unedited content, and identify the section which matches the published cropped content.",
