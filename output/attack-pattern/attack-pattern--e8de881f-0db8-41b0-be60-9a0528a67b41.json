They may be created to give legitimacy to narratives and allow them to suggest politically beneficial solutions to societal issues.<br><br> Legitimate think tanks could have a political bias that they may not be transparent about, they could use their persona for malicious purposes, or they could be exploited by threat actors (T0143.001: Authentic Persona, T0097.204: Think Tank Persona). For example, a think tank could take money for using their position to provide legitimacy to a false narrative, or be tricked into doing so without their knowledge.<br><br> <b>Associated Techniques and Sub-techniques</b><br> <b>T0097.107: Researcher Persona:</b> Institutions presenting as think tanks may also present researchers working within the organisation.",
