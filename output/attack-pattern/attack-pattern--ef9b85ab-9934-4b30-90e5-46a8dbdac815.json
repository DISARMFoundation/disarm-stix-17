            "description": "Exaggeration is a rhetorical technique that involves intentionally stretching the truth or emphasizing certain aspects of a situation beyond their actual proportions. It can serve as a persuasive, emotional, or stylistic device (for example, to dramatize a point, evoke strong reactions, or draw attention to an issue).<br><br>While exaggeration can be used playfully or for emphasis, in argumentation it often leads to distortion by misrepresenting reality or misleading an audience.<br><br>To make the assertion that a narrative is using exaggeration, analysts should look for language that amplifies reality beyond reasonable limits, for instance, claims that use absolute terms (\u201calways,\u201d \u201ceveryone,\u201d \u201cthe worst ever\u201d), vivid overstatements, or emotionally charged descriptions that make an issue seem far more extreme than evidence supports. Such cues often appear in opinion writing, political rhetoric, or advertising, where emotional appeal is prioritized over factual accuracy. To substantiate the claim, one should compare the narrative\u2019s description of events, numbers, or consequences with credible data or context; if the depiction consistently heightens intensity, danger, or significance without proportionate evidence, it can be reasonably identified as exaggeration.",
