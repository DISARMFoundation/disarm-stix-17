            "description": "Threat Actors have been observed harassing individuals by producing edits of them which introduce their visage to sexual content. This can have the impact of harming their reputation, or inducing feelings of shame or fear, and in some cases can risk physical violence against the target. While this technique can be used to target anyone, it is often levelled at women. <br><br>This Sub-Technique covers cases where images or videos depicting individuals are spliced into sexual media, or images or videos depicting them are edited to introduce sexual elements.<br><br>To make this assertion, analysts may identify the source imagery of the targeted individual (i.e. which media their visage was taken from) and confirm it didn\u2019t originally contain sexually explicit content. They may also look for editing artefacts (e.g. mismatched lighting, poor cropping or blurring, or unnatural angles where the visage has been introduced to the sexual scene).",
